# Distance Vector Routing Protocol (Project 2)

**Programming Assignment 2**  
**Simplified Distance Vector (DV) Routing Protocol using UDP**

---

## Overview

This project implements a **simplified version of the Distance Vector Routing Protocol**. Each server:
- Runs on a separate machine (or local IP)
- Reads a topology file
- Sends **periodic updates** to neighbors
- Uses **UDP** for communication
